# Natural Language Processing 

This repository documents the **Natural Language Processing concepts and techniques** covered during the semester through a series of hands-on assignments.  
The work emphasizes **text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, semantic understanding, and statistical language modeling** using Python-based NLP tools.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization
- Implemented multiple tokenization techniques:
  - Whitespace-based tokenization
  - Punctuation-based tokenization
  - Treebank tokenization
  - Tweet tokenization
  - Multi-Word Expression (MWE) tokenization
- Applied stemming using:
  - Porter Stemmer
  - Snowball Stemmer
- Performed lemmatization using lexical resources

---

### 2. Text Representation Techniques
- Bag-of-Words (BoW) modeling:
  - Raw count occurrence
  - Normalized count occurrence
- TF–IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- Dense word representations using **Word2Vec embeddings**

---

### 3. Text Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Text normalization and cleaning
- Stop-word removal
- Lemmatization
- Label encoding for categorical text labels
- Feature representation using TF–IDF
- Saved processed and vectorized outputs for downstream tasks

---

### 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Built a Named Entity Recognition system for real-world text
- Extracted entities such as:
  - Person
  - Organization
  - Location
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

---

### 5. Semantic Relationships using WordNet
- Explored lexical semantics through WordNet
- Identified and analyzed:
  - Synonymy
  - Antonymy
  - Hypernymy
  - Hyponymy
- Demonstrated semantic relationships within textual data

---

### 6. Machine Translation
- Developed a basic Machine Translation system
- Translated public information content from:
  - English to an Indian language
- Focused on preprocessing, token alignment, and translation logic

---

### 7. Text Preprocessing and Linguistic Analysis
- Built an NLP preprocessing and analysis application
- Performed:
  - Tokenization
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
  - Basic linguistic and syntactic analysis using NLTK

---

### 8. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
- Applied WordNet-based Word Sense Disambiguation
- Resolved ambiguity in words based on contextual meaning
- Improved semantic interpretation of ambiguous sentences

---

### 9. Sentiment Analysis for Indian Languages
- Designed a sentiment analysis system for an Indian language
- Used appropriate preprocessing and modeling techniques for non-English text
- Classified text into sentiment categories

---

### 10. N-gram Based Auto-Complete System
- Implemented an N-gram language model
- Built an auto-complete system using:
  - Unigrams
  - Bigrams
  - Trigrams
- Demonstrated applications in:
  - Text prediction
  - Language modeling
  - Probabilistic sequence generation

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of NLP preprocessing pipelines
- Ability to represent text using statistical and semantic methods
- Experience with core NLP tasks such as NER, sentiment analysis, WSD, and translation
- Strong foundation for advanced NLP and language model–based systems
